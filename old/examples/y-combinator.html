const Y_divergent = (F) =&gt; ( ((q) =&gt; F( q(q) )) (
                             ((q) =&gt; F( q(q) )) ) );

// The indentation has been adjusted to illustrate that the internal function is applied to a copy
// of itself.  To understand the operation, note that q is always equivalent to the function:
//
//     ((q) =&gt; F( q(q) ))
//
// q(q) is the fixed-point, and q keeps passing itself into itself at each recursive call, each
// time wrapping F(*) around the previous intermediate result.
//
// Unwrapping one invocation, Y(F) becomes F(q(q)) which is equivalent to F(Y(F)) because q is
// equivalent to ((q) =&gt; F( q(q) )).
//
// However, this implementation does not work with an applicative-order calling convention like
// that of JavaScript.  It endlessly recurses.  This can be fixed by converting to an applicative-
// order style of defintion.
//
// Applicative-Order Definition of a Fixed-Point "Y" Operator
//
// This next definition works under an applicative-order calling convention as in JavaScript.
// Here, Y's F argument is treated as a function whose parameter will be handled in call-by-name
// way as in Algol.  Call-by-name works similarly to how "calling" works in the Lamda Calculus,
// like substitution.  In Algol, call-by-name is implemented by wrapping a "thunk", i.e. a
// 0-parameter function, around a call-by-name argument expression, and then applying this thunk
// whenever the value of the argument is needed.  This wrapping and unwrapping is performed
// implicitly in Algol, but in JavaScript the mechanism must be made explicit.
//
// Therefore, Y's argument F must accept a thunk and then, when needed, explicitly apply that thunk
// to get the represented value.  Thus Y computes the fixed-point in the following sense:
// Y(F) is equivalent to F(() =&gt; Y(F)).  Y(F) returns the "unthunked" value of the fixed-point.
//
// Because the function F accepts a thunk t, the conditional logic in F can terminate the
// calculation by simply returning a value, or can recurse by applying t and calling that
// value with the recursive arguments.

const Y = (F) =&gt; ( ((q) =&gt; F( () =&gt; q(q) )) (
                   ((q) =&gt; F( () =&gt; q(q) )) ) );

const FactorialPattern = (factorial_thunk) =&gt; (n) =&gt; (n &lt;= 1) ? 1 : n*factorial_thunk()(n-1);
const factorial = Y(FactorialPattern);
await println(factorial);
await println(factorial(6));  // 720

const FibonacciPattern = (f_t) =&gt; (n) =&gt; (n &lt; 1) ? 0 : (n &lt; 2) ? 1 : f_t()(n-1) + f_t()(n-2);
const fibonacci = Y(FibonacciPattern);
await println(fibonacci(10));  // 55</eval-cell>
